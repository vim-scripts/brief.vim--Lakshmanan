The brief.vim Vim plugin emulates the brief editor key bindings and behavior
in Vim.

The brief editor has only one mode - insert-mode. This plugin uses the Vim
"insertmode" option to emulate the brief insert mode. This plugin will automatically
start the insert mode.  To properly use this plugin, you have to be in
insertmode always.  If you press escape, Vim will not go to the normal mode.
If you want to use any of the normal commands, press <C-o> and then the normal
mode command. 

This plugin uses the CTRL and ALT keys for the mappings. Before
using this plugin, make sure that the ALT and CTRL keys work in your Vim
installation.

The following list of brief like key-mappings are provided:
